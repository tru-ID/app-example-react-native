    - Android Studio or Android SDK manager via [Android developer downloads](https://developer.android.com/studio).
    - Set `ANDROID_HOME` environment variable (ie `export ANDROID_HOME=~/Library/Android/sdk`). Although `$ANDROID_HOME` is apparently deprecated it is still required.

- For metro bundler, require node version > 10
- Setup and run the [tru.ID example server](https://github.com/tru-ID/server-example-node)
- Install dependencies: `yarn install`
- Create configuration `cp .env.example .env` and update the `BASE_URL` value in the `.env` file to point to your running example server
- To run on iOS run `yarn ios` or to run on Android run `yarn android`
- Before running on Android make sure that the following is added to your application's `build.gradle` both within the buildscript/repositories and allprojects/repositories: 
```
maven {
        url "https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/22035475/packages/maven"
      }
```
